       something specific (such as a particular fact or information on a product)?~~
    6. ~~are they already familiar with the service or product that you offer or do they need to be introduced to it?~~
    7. ~~are they looking for time sensitive information, such as the latest news or updates on a particular topic?~~
    8. ~~do they want to discover information about a specific product or service to help them decide whether to buy it
       or not?~~

2. Your white paper should explain how you implemented concepts in visual hierarchy, grouping, and similarity in your
   design
3. Your white paper should take another website (that already exists on the web) and analyze it based on the above (i.e.
   answer all the questions [1a-1o] for your competitors website as well), creating a wireframe for it as well. You may
   use just their homepage for their wireframe. You may use a tool to build the wireframe
4. Your website should have at least four pages (all hosted locally, that can be accessed from one another). You must
   create a wireframe for each page.
    1. ~~Home Page~~ - Wireframe
    2. About - Wireframe
    3. ~~Menu~~ - Wireframe
    4. ~~Contact Us~~ - Wireframe
5. You must create a gray paper that explains the HTML, CSS, and JS that you did. It should outline at least 30
   different points, showing the code and explaining what it does.
6. Your HTML must include a minimum of one table, links, two lists, five images, a navigation bar, three forms (text
   box, radio button, checkbox, submit, and button), and anything else you like.
    1. ~~Table (Contact Us)~~
    2. ~~Links (Navigation Bar)~~
    3. Lists (Navigation Bar?)
    4. ~~Five Images (Home Page/Menu/Special Offer/Reviews)~~
    5. ~~Navigation Bar~~
    6. ~~Three Forms (Contact Us/Book a table)~~
7. Your CSS must be extensive and consistent with your business model and design.
8. You must implement the ideas in at least six examples from the Udemy course.
    1. ~~Carousel~~
    2. ?
    3. ?
